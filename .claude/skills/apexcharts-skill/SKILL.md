  AI skill for building ApexCharts.js charts and data visualizations (targets v7).
  Use when the user asks to create, configure, or troubleshoot any chart using ApexCharts
  (line, area, bar, pie, donut, radialBar, scatter, bubble, heatmap, candlestick, boxPlot,
  violin, histogram, radar, polarArea, rangeBar, rangeArea, treemap, funnel, pyramid, gauge,
  sunburst, icicle, unit, waffle, waterfall, dumbbell, streamgraph, raincloud). Covers
  correct data formats, lifecycle, formatters, tree-shaking, SSR, and the feature
  platform (plugins, canvas renderer, custom series, small multiples, undo/redo,
  shareable views, themes, crossfilter, annotation authoring, storyboard, streaming,
  drilldown). Knows which features ship in the default v7 bundle and which are an
  explicit import. In React /
  Vue / Angular projects, prefer the framework wrapper packages
  (`react-apexcharts`, `vue3-apexcharts`, `ng-apexcharts`) over the core API.

# ApexCharts AI Skill

> **Framework wrapper detection — check `package.json` before generating code.**
> - `react` → use **`react-apexcharts`** instead of the core API.
> - `vue` (Vue 3) → use **`vue3-apexcharts`**. Vue 2 → **`vue-apexcharts`**.
> - `@angular/core` → use **`ng-apexcharts`**.
>
> Wrappers handle `destroy()` automatically on unmount, accept reactive props, and forward events as idiomatic framework events. Use the core API directly only when no framework is detected, or when the user explicitly asks for vanilla. See `references/framework-wrappers.md`.

> **Targets ApexCharts v7.** Read the next box before writing any feature code: v7's headline change is that the default bundle no longer contains every feature.
>
> **⚠️ v7.0 breaking change: nine features left the default bundle.** In v6, `import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'` gave you every feature. In v7 it does not. These nine are **Tier 2**: present in the package, absent from the default bundle, and reachable only through an explicit import.
>
> ```js
> import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'
> import 'apexcharts/features/trellis'      // ESM
> ```
> ```html
> <script src=".../dist/apexcharts.js"></script>
> <script src=".../dist/features/trellis.js"></script>  <!-- script tag -->
> ```
>
> | Tier 2 feature | Import | gzip |
> |---|---|---|
> | Trellis (small multiples) | `apexcharts/features/trellis` | 25.7 KB |
> | Storyboard (scrollytelling) | `apexcharts/features/storyboard` | 8.0 KB |
> | Perspectives (shareable views) | `apexcharts/features/perspectives` | 6.7 KB |
> | Ink (annotation authoring) | `apexcharts/features/ink` | 6.2 KB |
> | Canvas renderer (Strata) | `apexcharts/features/renderer-canvas` | 6.0 KB |
> | Linked views & crossfilter | `apexcharts/features/link` | 5.3 KB |
> | Measure ruler | `apexcharts/features/measure` | 4.6 KB |
> | Rewind (undo / redo) | `apexcharts/features/history` | 3.2 KB |
> | Context menu | `apexcharts/features/context-menu` | 2.3 KB |
>
> The `raincloud` chart type (7.1) is Tier 2 on the same terms: `import 'apexcharts/raincloud'`. Storyboard registers Perspectives, so importing both costs no more than Storyboard alone. **Nothing fails silently**: each warns in the console when its config is present but the module is not, and degrades where it can (a trellis renders as one chart; `renderer: 'canvas'` falls back to SVG). Default bundle: 291,654 B gzipped in 6.10, 252,005 B in 7.0, 264,326 B in 7.1, about 270 KB in 7.6.
>
> Everything else stays in the default bundle: **all chart types except `raincloud` and `icicle`**, axes, tooltips, legend, toolbar, exports, annotations, keyboard navigation, stats, morph, drilldown, themes (Facet), plugins (Weave) and custom series (Marks). See `references/tree-shaking.md` for the full tier table and `references/feature-platform.md` for each feature's API.
>
> **Other v7.0 breaking changes.** (1) `plotOptions.bar.borderRadiusWhenStacked` was dropped as dead config in v7.0 and is a **working option again in v7.4**: `'all'` (the default) rounds both stack ends, `'last'` rounds only the far end and leaves the baseline square. Do not delete it from a config. (2) `dataLabels.animate.enabled` now defaults to `true` (bar/column only): labels ride to their new position on a data update instead of snapping. Set `dataLabels: { animate: { enabled: false } }` for the old behavior. Everything else from v5 and v6 keeps working unchanged.
>
> **Behaviors that are on by default** (both respect `prefers-reduced-motion`): data updates that add/remove points animate coherently, and one-finger kinetic pan is enabled (`chart.pan.inertia`). The two-finger gestures, pinch-zoom and two-finger pan, sit behind `chart.zoom.pinch`, which defaults to `'auto'`: **on only where the toolbar reset button is present**, so an unintended zoom is always undoable. `chart.zoom.allowMouseWheelZoom` is gated the same way. Set `pinch: true` to force the gestures on a toolbar-less chart, or see `chart.zoom.resetControl` (v7.4) for the other way to satisfy the gate.
>
> **Premium features and licensing.** Eight features are premium: `trellis` (small multiples, 7.0), `storyboard`, `link` (crossfilter / linked views), `ink` (annotation authoring), `measure`, `context-menu`, `perspectives` (shareable views), and `history` (undo/redo). Two chart types are premium: `unit` / `waffle`, and `raincloud` (7.1). These still function fully, but render an `APEXCHARTS` trial watermark until an entitled license is set via `ApexCharts.setLicense(key)` (static) or per-chart `chart.license`. They require a `premium` or `enterprise` plan; a `pro` key or the free tier keeps the watermark. Every other chart type and free module is never gated. Note that premium and Tier 2 are independent axes: `waterfall`, `dumbbell` and `streamgraph` are free *and* in the default bundle, while `trellis` is both premium *and* an explicit import. See the Licensing section in `references/feature-platform.md`.

## 1. Critical Rules

1. **Always call `chart.render()`** after `new ApexCharts(el, options)`. The constructor does not render.
2. **Always call `chart.destroy()`** before creating a new chart on the same element. Failing to do so causes memory leaks and duplicate charts (especially in React/Vue).
3. **Series data format is chart-type-specific.** Refer to the Data Format Table below. This is the #1 source of AI mistakes.
4. **`yaxis` must be an array** when using multiple y-axes. Each entry needs a `seriesName` to map to the correct series.
5. **`tooltip.shared` and `tooltip.intersect` are mutually exclusive.** `shared: true` shows all series at an x-position. `intersect: true` shows only the hovered point.
6. **Use `null` (not `undefined` or empty string)** for missing data points. `undefined` is silently ignored and breaks the chart.
7. **`chart.stacked: true`** only works with `bar` and `area` chart types.
8. **Responsive breakpoints** must be in ascending order in the `responsive` array.
9. **For mixed/combo charts**, set `type` on each individual series object, not just on `chart.type`.
10. **RadialBar values must be 0–100** (they represent percentages).
11. **Color hex values must include the `#` prefix** (e.g., `'#FF5733'`, not `'FF5733'`).
12. **Nine features are NOT in the v7 default bundle.** Before writing config for `trellis`, `storyboard`, `perspectives`, `ink`, `renderer: 'canvas'`, `link`, `measure`, `history` or the context menu, add its `apexcharts/features/*` import. Same for the `raincloud` and `icicle` chart types, which are not in the default bundle either. Full-bundle users need this too, not just tree-shakers. See the box above.
13. **Tree-shaking**: importing `apexcharts/core` gives you a bare class, and you must also import chart-type entries and feature entries separately.
14. **First-class aliases**: `funnel` and `pyramid` render through the bar engine; `gauge` renders through radialBar. Use them as `chart.type` directly (no `plotOptions.bar.isFunnel` needed). They are covered by the `apexcharts/bar` and `apexcharts/radialBar` tree-shaking entries respectively.
15. **`violin` (statistical)** uses a per-point density profile: `data: [{ x, y: { density: [[value, weight], ...], points?: [number] } }]`, not a plain number. Since v6.9 a datum may instead supply only raw observations (`points: [number]`, no `y`) and the library derives the density via KDE (needs `apexcharts/features/stats` when tree-shaking).
16. **`render()` is idempotent**: calling `render()` twice on the same instance returns the same promise instead of building a duplicate chart. You still must `destroy()` before creating a *new* instance on the same element.
17. **`histogram` (v6.9)** series carry **raw observations** (one number per event), not pre-aggregated counts; the chart chooses bin edges and counts them. Binning ships behind the stats feature: use the `apexcharts/histogram` entry, or `import 'apexcharts/features/stats'` alongside `apexcharts/bar` (the full `apexcharts` bundle already includes it).
18. **`waterfall` (v7.1) accumulates for you.** The series carries the **deltas**, not the running total. A row that should show the running total carries `isSubtotal` or `isTotal` and **no `y`**; the library measures it. Do not pre-compute cumulative values.
19. **`dumbbell` (v7.1) takes one series per measure**, each with the same `x` categories: `[{ name: '2020', data: [{ x, y }] }, { name: '2025', data: [{ x, y }] }]`. Do **not** zip the values into `y: [low, high]` pairs; that is the older `plotOptions.bar.isDumbbell` range-bar form, which still works but is a different chart.
20. **`raincloud` (v7.1) takes the raw sample**, one datum per category: `data: [{ x, points: [number] }]`. It is a premium Tier 2 type, so it needs `import 'apexcharts/raincloud'` on top of the default bundle.

## 2. Series Data Format Table

This is the most critical reference. Using the wrong data format is the #1 cause of broken charts.

### Axis Charts (line, area, bar, scatter, etc.)

| Chart Type | `chart.type` | Series Format | Minimal Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Line | `'line'` | `[{ name, data: [number \| null] }]` or `[{ name, data: [{ x, y }] }]` | `series: [{ name: 'Sales', data: [30, 40, null, 50] }]` |
| Area | `'area'` | Same as line | `series: [{ name: 'Views', data: [10, 20, 30] }]` |
| Bar / Column | `'bar'` | Same as line. Defaults to **vertical columns**; set `plotOptions.bar.horizontal: true` for horizontal bars. | `series: [{ name: 'Revenue', data: [44, 55, 41] }]` |
| Scatter | `'scatter'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y }] }]` — always use XY format | `series: [{ name: 'Points', data: [{ x: 1, y: 5 }, { x: 2, y: 10 }] }]` |
| Bubble | `'bubble'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y, z }] }]` — **z is required** (bubble size) | `series: [{ name: 'Data', data: [{ x: 1, y: 30, z: 10 }] }]` |
| Range Area | `'rangeArea'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y: [low, high] }] }]` | `series: [{ name: 'Temp', data: [{ x: 'Jan', y: [5, 15] }] }]` |
| Range Bar | `'rangeBar'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y: [start, end] }] }]` — for timeline/Gantt, use timestamps | `series: [{ name: 'Tasks', data: [{ x: 'Design', y: [1, 5] }] }]` |
| Candlestick | `'candlestick'` | `[{ data: [{ x, y: [O, H, L, C] }] }]` — array of 4: Open, High, Low, Close | `series: [{ data: [{ x: new Date('2024-01-01'), y: [51, 56, 48, 53] }] }]` |
| Box Plot | `'boxPlot'` | `[{ data: [{ x, y: [min, Q1, median, Q3, max] }] }]` — array of 5. *(v6.9)* Or supply the raw sample instead: `[{ data: [{ x, points: [number] }] }]` and the quartiles are computed (R type 7; needs the stats feature). | `series: [{ data: [{ x: 'Group A', y: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] }] }]` |
| Violin *(v6)* | `'violin'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y: { density: [[value, weight], ...], points?: [number] } }] }]`. *(v6.9)* Or supply the raw sample instead: `[{ name, data: [{ x, points: [number] }] }]` and the density is derived via KDE (needs the stats feature). | `series: [{ name: 'Sessions', data: [{ x: 'A', y: { density: [[20, 0.1], [30, 0.2]], points: [21, 29] } }] }]` |
| Histogram *(v6.9)* | `'histogram'` | `[{ name, data: [number] }]`: **raw observations**, one number per event, NOT pre-binned counts. The chart bins them (needs the stats feature). | `series: [{ name: 'Latency', data: [102, 87, 143, 91] }]` |
| Heatmap | `'heatmap'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y: number }] }]` — y is the intensity value | `series: [{ name: 'Mon', data: [{ x: '10am', y: 45 }] }]` |
| Treemap | `'treemap'` | `[{ data: [{ x, y: number }] }]` — y is the area/value. *(v6.9)* A datum may carry `children` to any depth for a nested treemap (see `references/grid-charts.md`). | `series: [{ data: [{ x: 'Item A', y: 100 }, { x: 'Item B', y: 60 }] }]` |
| Radar | `'radar'` | `[{ name, data: [number] }]` + `xaxis: { categories: [...] }` | `series: [{ name: 'Skill', data: [80, 50, 30, 40, 100] }]` |
| Funnel *(v6)* | `'funnel'` | `[{ name, data: [number] }]` + `xaxis: { categories: [...] }`. Order values **largest→smallest**. | `series: [{ data: [1380, 990, 548, 200] }]` |
| Pyramid *(v6)* | `'pyramid'` | Same as funnel; order values **smallest→largest** (wide base at bottom). | `series: [{ data: [200, 548, 990, 1380] }]` |
| Waterfall *(v7.1)* | `'waterfall'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, y }] }]` where **`y` is the signed delta**, not a running total. A running-total row carries `isSubtotal` (sum since the last cut) or `isTotal` (sum from zero) and **omits `y`**. | `series: [{ data: [{ x: 'Revenue', y: 8786 }, { x: 'Costs', y: -2786 }, { x: 'Gross', isSubtotal: true }] }]` |
| Dumbbell *(v7.1)* | `'dumbbell'` | **One series per measure**, sharing x categories: `[{ name, data: [{ x, y }] }, ...]`. Not `[low, high]` pairs. | `series: [{ name: '2020', data: [{ x: 'Backend', y: 92 }] }, { name: '2025', data: [{ x: 'Backend', y: 118 }] }]` |
| Streamgraph *(v7.1)* | `'streamgraph'` | Same as area: `[{ name, data: [{ x, y }] }]`. Stacking, baseline and band order are the chart's job, so do **not** set `chart.stacked`. | `series: [{ name: 'Drama', data: [{ x: '2024-01-01', y: 32 }] }]` |
| Raincloud *(v7.1, premium, Tier 2)* | `'raincloud'` | `[{ name, data: [{ x, points: [number] }] }]`: the **raw sample** per category; the density, box and rain are derived. Needs `import 'apexcharts/raincloud'`. | `series: [{ name: 'Weight gain', data: [{ x: 'Control', points: [3.1, 4.7, 2.9] }] }]` |

### Non-Axis Charts (pie, donut, radialBar, polarArea, gauge, unit, waffle)

These use a **flat number array** for `series`, NOT the object format:

```js
// CORRECT — flat number array + labels
{
  chart: { type: 'pie' },  // or 'donut', 'polarArea', 'radialBar', 'gauge', 'unit', 'waffle'
  series: [44, 55, 13, 43, 22],
  labels: ['Team A', 'Team B', 'Team C', 'Team D', 'Team E']
}
```

**Gauge *(v6)*** is a single-value radialBar alias: `series: [72]`, `labels: ['Progress']`. Configure the arc/needle, colored bands, ticks, and `min`/`max` domain through `plotOptions.radialBar` (see `references/circular-charts.md`).

**Unit / Waffle *(v6.6, premium)*** render one mark per unit of value (dot clusters, pictograms, waffles, beeswarms). Same flat-array + `labels` shape as pie; layout is chosen through `plotOptions.unit.layout`. A per-mark object form (`series: [{ name, data: [{ value, x, z, name, fillColor, id }] }]`) gives each mark its own color, position, size, and tooltip. `waffle` is a preset alias of `unit` (grid layout). Both render an `APEXCHARTS` watermark until an entitled license is set. See `references/circular-charts.md`.

### Hierarchical Charts (sunburst, icicle)

Both take the same tree, and the choice between them is a layout one: a sunburst spends the plot radially, an icicle spends it along a straight axis.

**Sunburst *(v6.7, free)*** draws tree-structured data as concentric rings (a nested pie / donut). It uses the axis-style `[{ data: [...] }]` wrapper, but each datum is an `{ x, y, children }` node nested to any depth:

```js
{
  chart: { type: 'sunburst' },
  series: [{
    data: [
      { x: 'Mobile', y: 55, children: [
        { x: 'iOS', y: 30, children: [{ x: 'iOS 17', y: 18 }, { x: 'iOS 16', y: 9 }] },
        { x: 'Android', y: 23 }
      ] },
      { x: 'Desktop', y: 33, children: [{ x: 'Windows', y: 20 }, { x: 'macOS', y: 10 }] }
    ]
  }]
}
```

Configure the centre hole, corner rounding, and inter-arc gap through `plotOptions.sunburst` (see `references/circular-charts.md`).

**Icicle *(v7.6, free, opt-in import)*** is the same partition in cartesian coordinates: one band per depth level, each child sized inside its parent's extent. Same data shape as the sunburst, and it also reads an existing `drilldown` config as plain data (no drilldown runtime needed). Labels stay horizontal at every depth and same-depth siblings line up across branches, which is what makes it the better pick for deep trees, call stacks and path funnels.

```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts/icicle'   // NOT in the default bundle

{
  chart: { type: 'icicle' },
  series: [{ data: [ /* the same { x, y, children } tree as above */ ] }],
  plotOptions: { icicle: { direction: 'up' } }   // flame-graph orientation
}
```

A branch may omit its own `y` and be the sum of its children *(fixed in v7.6 for both partition types)*. Configure depth direction, band thickness, leaf behaviour and zoom through `plotOptions.icicle` (see `references/grid-charts.md`).

import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts/client' # Browser: explicit client import for hydration
```

**Note (v7):** `apexcharts` gives you every chart type except `raincloud` and `icicle`, plus the Tier 1 features. The nine Tier 2 features, `raincloud` and `icicle` need their own import **whatever entry point you started from**. `apexcharts/features/all` is the Tier 1 set, so it is not a shortcut past this. Tree-shaking entries (`/core`, `/line`, etc.) are for reducing bundle size below the default.

**Note (v6.9):** ApexCharts is no longer dependency-free: it depends on `apex-commons` at runtime. npm resolves it automatically and the browser (script-tag) bundles inline it, so no action is needed; it only matters for tooling that assumed zero dependencies.

## 4. Core Lifecycle Pattern

```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'

// 1. Define options
const options = {
  chart: {
    type: 'line',
    height: 350
  },
  series: [{
    name: 'Sales',
    data: [30, 40, 35, 50, 49, 60, 70]
  }],
  xaxis: {
    categories: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
  }
}

// 2. Create chart instance
const chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector('#chart'), options)

// 3. Render (REQUIRED — constructor alone does not display the chart)
await chart.render()

// 4. Update data or options later
await chart.updateSeries([{
  name: 'Sales',
  data: [10, 20, 15, 30, 29, 40, 50]
}])

// Or merge new config options
await chart.updateOptions({
  title: { text: 'Updated Chart' }
})

// 5. Destroy when done (REQUIRED before unmounting in SPA frameworks)
chart.destroy()
```

## 5. Formatter Function Signatures

| Config Path | Signature | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `xaxis.labels.formatter` | `(value: string \| number, timestamp?: number, opts?) => string` | Formatted x-axis tick label |
| `yaxis.labels.formatter` | `(value: number, opts?) => string` | Formatted y-axis tick label |
| `tooltip.x.formatter` | `(value: number, opts?) => string` | Tooltip x-value text |
| `tooltip.y.formatter` | `(value: number, opts?) => string` | Tooltip y-value text |
| `tooltip.y.title.formatter` | `(seriesName: string, opts?) => string` | Tooltip series title |
| `tooltip.z.formatter` | `(value: number) => string` | Tooltip z-value (bubble) |
| `dataLabels.formatter` | `(value: number \| string \| number[], opts?) => string \| number` | Data label text |
| `legend.formatter` | `(legendName: string, opts?) => string` | Legend item text |
| `plotOptions.pie.donut.labels.value.formatter` | `(val: string) => string` | Donut center value |
| `plotOptions.pie.donut.labels.total.formatter` | `(w: { globals, config }) => string` | Donut center total |
| `plotOptions.radialBar.dataLabels.value.formatter` | `(val: number) => string` | RadialBar center value |

**Important:** All formatters must return a `string` (or `number` for `dataLabels.formatter`). Never return `undefined`.

**Per-point data label offsets (v6.8):** `dataLabels.offsetX` and `dataLabels.offsetY` accept `number | ((opts) => number)`. The function receives `{ series, seriesIndex, dataPointIndex, w }` (same signature as `dataLabels.style.colors` functions), so colliding labels from two series at the same x can be pushed apart, e.g. `offsetY: ({ seriesIndex }) => (seriesIndex === 0 ? -12 : 12)`. Keep it pure; it may be called more than once per label.

## 6. Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

### Pitfall 1: Wrong series data format for chart type

❌ **WRONG** — pie chart with axis-chart series format:
```js
{ chart: { type: 'pie' }, series: [{ name: 'A', data: [44, 55] }] }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — pie chart uses flat number array + labels:
```js
{ chart: { type: 'pie' }, series: [44, 55, 13], labels: ['A', 'B', 'C'] }
```

### Pitfall 2: Not calling render()

❌ **WRONG** — chart never appears:
```js
const chart = new ApexCharts(el, options)
// Missing render() call!
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```js
const chart = new ApexCharts(el, options)
await chart.render()
```

### Pitfall 3: Not destroying before re-creating (React/Vue memory leak)

❌ **WRONG** — creates duplicate charts:
```js
useEffect(() => {
  const chart = new ApexCharts(ref.current, options)
  chart.render()
}, [options])
```

✅ **CORRECT** — destroy on cleanup:
```js
useEffect(() => {
  const chart = new ApexCharts(ref.current, options)
  chart.render()
  return () => chart.destroy()
}, [options])
```

### Pitfall 4: Mixing xaxis.type with wrong data format

❌ **WRONG** — datetime axis with string dates (not timestamps):
```js
{
  xaxis: { type: 'datetime' },
  series: [{ data: [{ x: 'January 2024', y: 30 }] }]
}
```

✅ **CORRECT** — datetime axis with timestamps or Date objects:
```js
{
  xaxis: { type: 'datetime' },
  series: [{ data: [{ x: new Date('2024-01-01').getTime(), y: 30 }] }]
}
```

Also: do NOT use `xaxis.categories` when your data already has `{ x, y }` format — categories are ignored.

### Pitfall 5: Multiple y-axes not as array

❌ **WRONG** — yaxis as single object:
```js
{
  series: [{ name: 'Revenue', data: [...] }, { name: 'Profit', data: [...] }],
  yaxis: { title: { text: 'Revenue' } }
}
```

✅ **CORRECT** — yaxis as array with seriesName mapping:
```js
{
  series: [{ name: 'Revenue', data: [...] }, { name: 'Profit', data: [...] }],
  yaxis: [
    { seriesName: 'Revenue', title: { text: 'Revenue ($)' } },
    { seriesName: 'Profit', opposite: true, title: { text: 'Profit (%)' } }
  ]
}
```

### Pitfall 6: tooltip.shared vs tooltip.intersect

❌ **WRONG** — both enabled (conflicting):
```js
{ tooltip: { shared: true, intersect: true } }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — pick one mode:
```js
// Mode A: Show all series values at x-position (default for line/area)
{ tooltip: { shared: true, intersect: false } }

// Mode B: Show only hovered data point (better for scatter)
{ tooltip: { shared: false, intersect: true } }
```

**Reaching content inside a `custom` tooltip *(v7.6)***: a tooltip closes as the pointer leaves the data point, so a link or button returned by `custom` can never be clicked. `tooltip.interactive: true` holds it open while the pointer is over it. It is off by default, and while it is on `followCursor` is **ignored** (a tooltip that trails the cursor retreats from every approach); the configured `followCursor` value is left alone and applies again the moment `interactive` goes back off.

```js
{ tooltip: { interactive: true, custom: ({ seriesIndex }) => `<a href="/detail/${seriesIndex}">Open</a>` } }
```

### Pitfall 7: Wrong formatter signatures

❌ **WRONG** — using y-axis formatter signature for tooltip:
```js
{
  tooltip: { y: { formatter: (val, timestamp, opts) => `$${val}` } }
}
```

✅ **CORRECT** — tooltip.y.formatter only receives `(val, opts)`:
```js
{
  tooltip: { y: { formatter: (val, opts) => `$${val}` } },
  yaxis: { labels: { formatter: (val) => `$${val.toFixed(0)}` } }
}
```

### Pitfall 8: undefined instead of null for missing data

❌ **WRONG** — undefined breaks the chart:
```js
{ series: [{ data: [10, undefined, 30, undefined, 50] }] }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — use null:
```js
{ series: [{ data: [10, null, 30, null, 50] }] }
```

### Pitfall 9: Stacking on unsupported chart types

❌ **WRONG** — stacking on scatter chart:
```js
{ chart: { type: 'scatter', stacked: true } }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — stacking only works on bar and area:
```js
{ chart: { type: 'bar', stacked: true } }
// or
{ chart: { type: 'area', stacked: true } }
```

### Pitfall 10: Mixed/combo charts missing per-series type

❌ **WRONG** — no type on individual series:
```js
{
  chart: { type: 'line' },
  series: [
    { name: 'Sales', data: [10, 20, 30] },      // renders as line
    { name: 'Profit', data: [5, 12, 18] }        // also renders as line!
  ]
}
```

✅ **CORRECT** — set type per series:
```js
{
  chart: { type: 'line' },
  series: [
    { name: 'Sales', type: 'column', data: [10, 20, 30] },
    { name: 'Profit', type: 'line', data: [5, 12, 18] }
  ]
}
```

### Pitfall 11: RadialBar values > 100

❌ **WRONG** — raw values (renders incorrectly):
```js
{ chart: { type: 'radialBar' }, series: [340, 520, 190] }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — use percentages 0–100:
```js
{ chart: { type: 'radialBar' }, series: [76, 67, 61], labels: ['A', 'B', 'C'] }
```

### Pitfall 12: Colors without # prefix

❌ **WRONG**:
```js
{ colors: ['FF5733', '33FF57'] }
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```js
{ colors: ['#FF5733', '#33FF57'] }
```

### Pitfall 13: Responsive breakpoints not ascending

❌ **WRONG** — descending order:
```js
{ responsive: [{ breakpoint: 1024, options: {...} }, { breakpoint: 480, options: {...} }] }
```

✅ **CORRECT** — ascending order:
```js
{ responsive: [{ breakpoint: 480, options: {...} }, { breakpoint: 1024, options: {...} }] }
```

### Pitfall 14: Missing feature imports

Two distinct versions of this. **(a) Per-type entries carry no features:**

❌ **WRONG** — toolbar/legend/annotations silently missing:
```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts/line'
// No feature imports! Legend, toolbar, annotations won't appear.
```

✅ **CORRECT** — import needed features:
```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts/line'
import 'apexcharts/features/legend'
import 'apexcharts/features/toolbar'
import 'apexcharts/features/annotations'
```

**(b) *(v7)* The full bundle no longer carries the nine Tier 2 features.** This one catches people who never tree-shook anything, and it is the most common v6 → v7 upgrade failure.

❌ **WRONG**: the config is right, the module is absent, so the chart renders as one plain chart and logs a warning:
```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'
new ApexCharts(el, { chart: { type: 'line' }, series, trellis: { by: 'region' } })
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```js
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'
import 'apexcharts/features/trellis'
```

Same for `storyboard`, `perspectives`, `ink`, `renderer: 'canvas'`, `link`, `measure`, `history`, `contextMenu`, and the `raincloud` chart type. Check the console: each one names both import routes when its config is present without it. `icicle` is the exception to the "warns and degrades" rule: an unregistered chart type **throws**, and the thrown message names both routes.

### Pitfall 15: SSR — wrong import path

`apexcharts` resolves by environment: the `"."` export's `node` condition points at the SSR bundle, so `import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'` on a server **does** carry `renderToString` / `renderToHTML`. Import `apexcharts/ssr` explicitly anyway, so the intent survives a bundler that resolves the `browser` condition while targeting Node:
```js
// On server:
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts/ssr'
const svg = await ApexCharts.renderToString(options)

// On client (for hydration): target the wrapper renderToHTML emitted,
// which carries data-apexcharts-hydrate and NO id.
import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'  // or 'apexcharts/client'
ApexCharts.hydrateAll()  // or hydrate(document.querySelector('[data-apexcharts-hydrate]'))
```

### Pitfall 16: updateOptions vs updateSeries vs appendData

❌ **WRONG** — full updateOptions just to change data:
```js
chart.updateOptions({ series: [{ data: newData }] })
```

✅ **CORRECT** — use the right method:
```js
// Replace all series data (most common)
await chart.updateSeries([{ name: 'Sales', data: newData }])

// Add data points to existing series (real-time streaming)
await chart.appendData([{ data: [newPoint] }])

// Change config (title, colors, axis, etc.)
await chart.updateOptions({ title: { text: 'New Title' } })
```

## 9. Feature Platform

Every feature below is off by default in config terms. The **Tier** column is about the *bundle*: Tier 1 is already in `import ApexCharts from 'apexcharts'` and needs a `features/*` import only if you started from `/core` or a per-type entry; **Tier 2 needs its import no matter which entry point you used**. Full config shapes, APIs, and examples are in `references/feature-platform.md`.

| Feature | Tier | Import | One-liner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weave** (plugins) | 1 | `apexcharts/features/weave` | Publish reusable chart plugins against a stable `ApexCharts.registerPlugin({ name, setup })` API; activate per chart with `plugins: [{ name }]`. Contract is at **v6** (v7.5): `info`/`categories`/`markDerived` (v2), `reserve` (v3), `pointer` (v4), `claim`/`drawn`/`declare`/`can` (v6). Declare the **lowest** `apiVersion` you can run on and feature-detect the rest: a host older than the version you declare skips your plugin outright. |
| **Marks** (custom series) | 1 | `apexcharts/features/marks` | `ApexCharts.registerSeriesType(name, { renderItem })` for first-class custom marks (lollipop, bullet). Baseline is `scales.y(0)`, **not** `api.zeroY`. |
| **Facet** (themes/tokens) | 1 | `apexcharts/features/facet` | `theme: { follow: 'os', name }`, `--apx-*` CSS custom props, `ApexCharts.registerTheme`. |
| **Drilldown** | 1 | `apexcharts/features/drilldown` | `drilldown: { enabled, series }` + a `drilldown` id on data points; `chart.drillDown()/drillUp()`. v6.9 adds line/area support, async levels (`onDrillDown` may return a Promise), a loading overlay, and the `drillDownError` event. |
| **Morph** | 1 | `apexcharts/features/morph` | Animated transitions between chart types. |
| **Stats** | 1 | `apexcharts/features/stats` | *(v6.9)* Statistics behind histogram binning, boxPlot/violin raw-sample summaries (R type 7 quartiles, KDE), and `chart.rowSeries()`. The `apexcharts/histogram` entry includes it. |
| **Cadence** (easing) | core | none | `chart.animations.easing` accepts a named curve, cubic-bezier array, or function; `ApexCharts.registerEasing`. |
| **Streaming** | core | none | `chart: { streaming: { enabled, maxPoints } }` for constant-velocity rolling-window scroll. |
| **Print layout** | core | none | *(v7.1)* `chart: { print: { enabled, width } }`. The paper box cannot be measured from JS (`clientWidth` and `matchMedia` both report the screen during `beforeprint`), so the chart is re-laid out at a known width for the sheet and restored after. **On by default** at `width: 700` (suits A4 / Letter portrait); a chart already narrower is left alone. `print: false` restores the pre-7.1 behavior. |
| **Marker batching** | core | none | *(v7.0)* `markers: { largeDatasetThreshold: n }`. Above `n` points, a series' markers are drawn as one path per marker size instead of one element per point. **Opt-in, default `0` (off)**, because merged marker paths are not pixel-identical: overlapping markers lose their individual outlines and dense clusters read flatter. Also covers the markers `showNullDataPoints` adds, which is what makes a null-heavy series slow even at `size: 0`. |
| **Trellis** (small multiples) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/trellis` | *(v7.0, premium)* `trellis: { by: 'region', minPanelWidth }` splits the series into a grid of real charts sharing one scale, legend, toolbar and crosshair. Also `row` × `column` for 2-D grids. |
| **Strata** (canvas) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/renderer-canvas` | `chart: { renderer: 'auto', rendererThreshold }` paints the dense series layer to canvas while axes/tooltips/exports stay SVG. Falls back to SVG if the module is missing. |
| **Rewind** (undo/redo) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/history` | *(premium)* `chart: { history: { enabled: true } }`, then `chart.history.undo()/redo()/jump()/transaction()`. |
| **Perspectives** (view state) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/perspectives` | *(premium)* `chart.perspectives.capture()/toURL()/apply()` to serialize and restore the exact view. |
| **Link** (crossfilter) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/link` | *(premium)* `chart: { group, link: { enabled, mode } }` for highlight linking; `ApexCharts.crossfilter({ id, records })` for a filter engine. |
| **Ink** (annotation authoring) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/ink` | *(premium)* `chart: { ink: { enabled: true } }` makes annotations draggable/resizable with a floating editor. |
| **Measure** (ruler) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/measure` | *(premium)* `chart: { measure: { enabled, mode } }`; hold a key and drag to read change/percent/slope. v6.1 adds a toolbar tool (`toolbar.tools.measure`, `toolbar.autoSelected: 'measure'`). |
| **Context menu** | **2** | `apexcharts/features/context-menu` | *(premium)* `chart: { contextMenu: { enabled, items } }` for point-specific right-click actions. |
| **Storyboard** (scrollytelling) | **2** | `apexcharts/features/storyboard` | *(premium)* `chart.storyboard.bind({ beats })` pairs prose sections with saved views. Registers Perspectives too. |
